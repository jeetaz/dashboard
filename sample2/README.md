Sortable, Resizable layout using Gridster with Charts using HighCharts
=========

The demo is developed using Gridster and HighCharts and supports grid layout having sortable and resizable features.

It also saves state of the layout when you drag and drop the sortable element or resize the element in cookies so if you refresh the page, it loads the previously saved state. Gridster provides serialize method to get the element's position which is used to save and load state feature.

Possible extensions to this layout could include responsive support.
