jQuery Sortable Grid With CSS3 Transitions
=========

Using jQuery sortable and by following animating grid with CSS3 transitions blog post from @stevensanderson the demo is prepared.

It sotable rearranges layout based on selected height & width of sortable element as per current window size. It also keep minimum size promise and if the window size is less than sortable minimum size you can see the scroll for sure. Try resizing the browser or view it at higher resolution to see it working. And yes, it uses underscore's debounce for handling browser resizing.

Possible extension could be saving the state of the sortable layout and rearrange sortable layout based on number of rows X columns instead of widht X height.
